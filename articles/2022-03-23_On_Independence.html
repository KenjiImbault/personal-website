<h1>2022-03-23 On independence</h1>
<p>
Finally! My first writing. <br />
Today, we'll be talking about the independence of the individual (So we'll not be delving into independence of states, of societies...), but to keep it concise, we'll write "independence" instead of "independence of the individual". <br />
I am also not a good writer or a philosopher, so excuse me if this is unpleasant to read and/or not well though-out. <br />
With that out of the way, let's get into it!

<h3 id="I">I. What is independence</h3>
<p>
Definition of independent: <br />
A being X is independent from Y (Y being an object, a concept, or an entity) if they can live* without Y.<br />
("Live" can refer to "survive" or to "enjoy life", amongst other things, but we will not go too philosophical here. Most of the time, in this definition, "live" will mean "continue to experience life with little to no difference from before, with few or without drawbacks")
</p>

<h3 id="II">II. List of things you depend on</h3>
<p>
To illustrate the definition, nothing better than some examples.<br />
Let's take food as the first example.<br />
Can you live without food? No, therefore you are dependent on food.<br />
Now, where do you get your food? If you buy food from the market, then, you are also dependent on the market, because you cannot live without it.<br />
With this example, we saw that not only we are dependent on things, but also on the provider of those things.<br /><br />

We can't really get independent from food, however, we can get independent from the provider of food. By growing your own food for example.<br />
If you grow your own food, you will be independent from the market.<br /><br />

However, there are more subtle forms of dependence, such as sugar, or maybe coffee.<br />
Let's imagine someone being addicted to coffee. They are not independent from coffee, because if it were to disappear, they would not live as they were.<br />
(They would survive, but with drawbacks (withdrawal for example))
</p>

<h3 id="III">III. The layers of dependence</h3>
<p>
I would argue that there is three layers of stuff we depend on;<br />
(There is no clear border between these layers, it's more like a spectrum, but it is easier to visualize this as a pyramid, like Maslow's pyramid)<br /><br />
The first layer: The basic needs layer<br />
This layer contains anything that, if it were to disappear, you would be in grave danger.<br />
So, food for example, but also your provider of food. Water, as well as the provider of water. Money and housing also.<br /><br />

The second layer: The secondary needs layer<br />
This layer contains anything that, if it were to disappear, you would be in danger in the long term.<br />
For example, if you need your car to go to work, then your car is in the secondary layer. If it were to disappear, you would be in danger in the long term, because you won't be able to earn money, which is in the first layer.<br /><br />

The third layer: The entertainment layer<br />
This layer contains anything that, if it were to disappear, you would be inconvenienced.<br />
It is in this layer that we will find most addictions, such as drugs, pornography...<br />
For example, if you like watching YouTube, then it would be in this layer. Because if it were to disappear, you would not be in danger, but it would be an annoyance.<br /><br />

These layers of dependence are different for every person, as well as the time.<br />
If you need your computer to work (and thus earn money), then electricity and your electricity provider is between the first layer and the second layer.<br />
However, if you only use your computer for leisure, then electricity (and it's provider) would be more towards the third layer.<br />
I would like to add that not everything that you are dependent to is bad. You may be dependent on books (Which goes into layer 3) because you enjoy reading, but reading is not a bad thing.
</p>

<h3 id="IV">IV. Short-term independence VS long-term independence</h3>
<p>
It is advantageous to sacrifice short-term independence, if you gain long-term independence.<br />
To go back to the example of food, you need food to survive. And if you buy food from the market, you are dependent on the market.<br />
Now, if you decide to grow your own food, you need to have the seeds, as well as fertile soil. And where do you get these? You can simply buy them from a market too. Here, you will be shortly dependent on the market to buy the seeds/soil, but it is only for a very brief moment, and in the end, you will be more independent.<br />
The same logic applies to entertainment that you regularly consume.<br />
Let's say that you want to read a book. If you read it online, you will be dependent on the service that provides you the book. (You need to continuously connect to the website too keep reading that book)<br />
However, if you download the book, or if you own it physically (which is equal in term of independence), you won't depend on that service.<br /><br />

In conclusion: Owning material locally (or physically) is better for independence than to use a service regularly.
</p>

<h3 id="V">V. When you need to sacrifice independence, who do you sacrifice it to?</h3>
<p>
Which is better, to buy food from the supermarket, or to buy food from a local producer?<br />
From an independence standpoint, buying from the supermarket makes you dependent on the supermarket, as well as on the suppliers of the supermarket, which themselves are dependent on other things (such as transports etc...), whereas buying from the local producer makes you dependent from the producer, and that's it.<br />
So, you are actually more independent buying from the local producer, than from the supermarket.<br />
From this example, it seems that if you have to sacrifice independence, sacrifice the least possible. (Sounds stupid, but as we saw with the example above, it is not always so simple to think about)
</p>

<h3 id="VI">VI. Can't be independent on the Internet</h3>
<p>
It is, by design, impossible to be completely independent on the Internet.<br />
The Internet is a network, which means that it is made by interacting with other people.<br />
Being dependent on the Internet would mean "Live without stuff other people made", which is exactly what the Internet is about.<br />
So, if you *truly* want to be independent, you have to live without Internet. Of course, this is impractical for most of us, but even then, it is interesting to note that, to be more independent on the Internet, you can simply use the Internet less.<br />
With that out of the way, how to use the Internet, and be more independent?
</p>

<h3 id="VII">VII. Self-hosting and independence</h3>
<p>
To be independent on the Internet means that you are using less stuff that other people made.<br />
For example, you are dependent on your Email provider (such as Google, with Gmail). Or, if you have a website, you are dependent on the hosting service that hosts your website (such has GitHub, with GitHub pages).<br />
Maybe you use Messenger, to communicates with friends, in which case, you are dependent on Facebook.<br />
How do you continue to use these kinds of services without being dependent on any company?<br />
Self-hosting is the answer.<br />
Self-hosting is doing all of the above, but yourself, on your own computer.<br />
That means, making your own email "provider" (so when you receive Emails, it will directly go to your machine, and not towards the email provider's server), hosting your own website on your machine, and hosting your own instant messaging instance (with XMPP for example).<br />
Of course, these are not the only things that you are dependent of. Think about everything you do on the Internet, and try to see if you can self-host it (You may be dependent on a search engine like Google for example.)<br />
Another thing, that is obvious, is that you are dependent on the website that you go to. If you regularly go to Wikipedia, then you are dependent on Wikipedia. But how do you continue to use the service that Wikipedia provides, whilst being independent? Well, you can simply *download* Wikipedia (yes, you can actually do that!) on your local computer, and you won't even be needing an Internet connection to have the service that it provides.<br /><br />

Does that mean that you need to download every website that you regularly use? Well, if you want to be more independent, yes. Of course, this method doesn't work if you want the information that you downloaded to be updated regularly. If that is the case, that means that you need to download the new website regularly, and at this point, it is less of a hassle to just use the website (because if you download the website regularly, in term of independence, it is exactly the same as visiting the website regularly).<br />
We saw in IV. that it is better to own material, so this applies to music, movies, books, YouTube videos...<br />
To be more independent, instead of using Spotify, download the songs. Instead of streaming, download the movies. Instead of using Kindle, download the books. Instead of watching videos on YouTube, download them. And so on and so forth.<br /><br />

Not only can you consume content independently, but you can also create content independently.<br />
Instead of making a blog on Blogger, make a blog on your own website that you self-host.<br />
Instead of uploading videos to YouTube, upload them on a website that you self-host.<br />
So on and so forth.<br />
Self-hosting content that you make, makes you more independent, but it as the (positive?) side effect of making the Internet more decentralized. We won't go into decentralization, but it is tightly linked to independence, as well as privacy.<br /><br />

Because of all self-host, it may hard to find the required disk space to stock all of that data.<br />
It may be advantageous to buy a NAS, or to make your own. (As we saw in IV., buying a NAS and/or add disk space will make you dependent to the supplier for a short while, but you will gain in independence in the long run.)
</p>

<h3 id="VIII">VIII. Free software brings you more independence</h3>
<p>
Free software is software where you can see everything on how it was written.<br />
That means that you are able to see the code, and thus, you are in theory, able to make the software yourself just by copying the code.<br />
Non-free software however, is software where you cannot see the code. And thus, if I were to present you a non-free software, you won't be able to replicate it.<br />
This already, shows us that free software is more independent than non-free software, because you can make the software yourself.<br />
However, this is not all. Non-free software is like a black box, and you don't know what is happening inside that box. Maybe it's communicating with a server somewhere else? Therefore, you are more dependent than if you were using free software, where you can see if the software you are using is communicating with a server.
</p>

<h3 id="IX">IX. Conclusion: Do I do all of this, and should you do it?</h3>
<p>
I do not do all of this. It is impractical.<br />
I wrote this for two reasons:<br />
To show you that, you CAN be more independent, even if you won't ever be 100% independent.<br />
For more practical reasons, being more independent means that there is less weak points in your way of living.<br />
Being more independent, also makes you "smarter", because you need to learn the skills to be more independent (if you want to grow your own food, you have to learn how to tend a garden for example)<br />
I also (mainly) made this for myself, to put my thoughts in place, as well as to be able to come back to this later, when I need it.<br />
As for you, you should not necessary try to be more independent if it sacrifices your happiness, however, I also think that you can find peace of mind and/or the "meaning of life" in trying to be more independent. The same way that religious people try to be closer to God every day, without ever being God themselves; You too can "try to be closer to independence, without ever being 100% independent yourself"<br />
Maybe, if you lost meaning in life, try to set yourself the goal to be "as independent as possible", maybe, like religion for some people, you will find new meaning. And just like religion, every small steps counts.<br /><br />

Maybe you disagree with everything I have said, maybe you are thinking "Uh? That guy is full of contradictions!" or maybe "Well, that was an extreme point of view...", but keep in mind that I did not write this to make you believe what I believe, but rather to make you think on this subject, and if, even if it's just once, you thought "Uh. I completely disagree with that statement, but it is interesting.", then I am satisfied.<br />
Also, things may be out of place, I did wrote this late at night after a hot shower. (Yes, this whole writing is just a shower thought!)<br /><br />

Thank you for reading, I hope it was interesting to read, please remember that I am not a writer or a philosopher. If you want to say something to me, I'll be glad to read anything you send me on my contacts.
